# Quize_game
A quiz game in Java programming is a project that allows you to create an interactive quiz application using the Java language. You can use various features such as multiple-choice questions, timers, score tracking, and user input to make your quiz game more engaging and fun.
You can also use a database or a file to store your questions and answers, and use a graphical user interface or a command-line interface to display your quiz game.

If you want to create a quiz game in Java programming, you will need to have some basic knowledge of Java syntax, data structures, loops, conditional statements, methods, classes, and objects. You will also need to have a Java development environment, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, and a Java compiler, such as JDK or JRE. You can use GitHub to host your project and share it with others.
